## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by going to the CVE website and use the webform https://cveform.mitre.org/. Please include vulnerability details, steps to reproduce (e.g., proof-of-concept code, screenshots) and an assessment of the impact in your report. We appreciate concise and high quality reports.

#### Web Form Guide

- In the “Select a request type” drop down menu, please select “other”  
- Enter your email address in the space provided  
- You may enter a PGP key if you prefer to encrypt your correspondence  
- In the “Type of comment” drop down menu, please select “Issue”  
- In the textbox labelled “Please provide your question, issue, comment, etc.” please start the message with the following information:

## Scope

The services within [this](https://github.com/CVELab/cve-services-doc) repository are in scope, including the ESUS, IDR, and the User Registry. Vulnerabilities in upstream dependencies and infrastructure are in scope. As a future hosted web service, the version is currently considered "beta" until officially released and then it will be marked v1. As such, please report any vulnerabilities discovered in a release, dev, or master branch that exists.

## Fixes

We will release fixes and assign CVE IDs for verified security vulnerabilities. We expect to publish vulnerabilities using GitHub [security advisories](https://github.com/CVELab/cve-services/security/advisories).

## Coordination

We appreciate the opportunity to investigate and develop fixes before public disclosure, following coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices. We intend to respond to new reports within 48 hours and fix verified vulnerabilities within 90 days.

For vulnerabilities that affect upstream dependencies, we can assist reporting and coordinating with the appropriate parties. We will not share your identification without your permission, but may share the other relevant parts of your report.
