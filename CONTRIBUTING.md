## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by Github's most minimal [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior in a direct message to [@mattrbianchi](https://gitter.im/mattrbianchi).

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

> **Note:** Please don't file an issue to ask a question. You'll get faster results by using the resources below.

You can [join the AWG Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/cve-awg/community).  
   * Even though Gitter is a chat service, sometimes it takes several hours for community members to respond &mdash; please be patient!

## What should I know before I get started?

### Design Decisions

When we make a significant decision in how we maintain the project and what we can or cannot support, we will document it in [cve-services-doc](https://github.com/CVELab/cve-services-doc). If you have a question around how we do things, check to see if it is documented there. If it is *not* documented there, please [join the AWG Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/cve-awg/community) and ask your question.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](https://github.com/CVELab/cve-services/blob/dev/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the logs.
<!-- * **Check the [FAQs on the forum](todo)** for a list of common questions and problems. -->
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/CVELab/cve-services/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/CVELab/cve-services/blob/dev/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Atom, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Atom otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Atom command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of the API are you using?**
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?

### Code Proposals
This section guides you through submitting a code proposal for CVE services, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your proposal and find related suggestions.

Before creating a code proposal, please check [this list](https://github.com/CVELab/cve-services/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22code+proposal%22) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a code proposal, please fill in [the template](https://github.com/CVELab/cve-services/blob/dev/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Code Proposal?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Please make sure to provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps when applicable**. Include copy/paste-able snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why (if applicable).
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as an outside service that just integrates with the API.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` labels:

* [good first issue](https://github.com/CVELab/cve-services/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.

If diving head first still seems daunting, the development team will be holding a designated office hour every Monday on [the AWG Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/cve-awg/community) 3-4PM (EST/EDT) for pre-sprint planning. All that are interested in contributing to the project can come into the room to see what we plan to work on in the coming sprint.

#### Local development

### Branching Strategy

This project aims to follow the [git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) model of branching. Adding the issue in the branch name (#1 or issue-1) makes it easier to tie the branch to defined work.

An additional best practice is to create a pull request after creating the branch but before getting started on development. This helps inform maintainers and other contributors that work has started on an issue, decreasing the chance someone else picks it up. The PR title should be prefixed with WIP (Work In Progress) so reviewers know the PR is not ready for review.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible solutions
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).

### Specs Styleguide

- Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) specs in the `./spec` folder.
- Treat `describe` as a noun or situation.
- Treat `it` as a statement about state or how an operation changes state.

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [ApiDoc](http://apidocjs.com/).
