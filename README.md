# CVE Project Documentation

This branch hosts the source for the [Github pages site](https://cvelab.github.io/cve-services/) for the CVE Services project.

This site uses Jekyll and Bundler. To build this site locally, you need to [install](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) Ruby and Ruby Gems.

If you don't have bundler installed, run:

```
gem install bundler
```

To setup Jekyll, run:

```
bundle config set path 'vendor/bundle'
bundler install
```

To run the site locally, run:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
